  
 The steps in Chirpsounder2 are – 
    (I)  Collect data – thor.py (creates raw I/Q data)
    (II) Set configurations (Sample rate etc.)
   (III) Detect chirps (detect_chirps.py) (creates chirp ...h5 files)
   (IV)  Find Timings of those chirps (find_timings.py) (creates par...h5 files)
    (V)  Generate Ionograms (Calc_Ionograms.py) (creates lfm ... h5 files)
   (VI)  Plot Ionograms (plot_Ionograms.py) (makes plot from the lfm  files)

      - find in Juha's code how he captures the data/stores the data/trains them/ 
      - install tensorflow (CPU ? or GPU ? )

Label -- Training Set and Validation Set --- Apply AI to get model --- Apply the model in the Validation Set --- and ???

From observation of iono_scale package, the steps could be : 
 1. label_iono
 2. iono_learn
 3. iono_scale_validate
 4. iono_scale
 
 The workflow is : 
      (i)   Collect data
      (ii)  Build model
      (iii) Train the network
      (iv)  Evaluate
      (v)   Predict

Steps for today -- 
                      (1) Apply find_timings.py/Calc_Ionograms.py/plot_Ionograms.py .. I can't apply Calc_Ionograms.py as it requires reading files from data collected as thor.py which I don't have. 
                      (2) Watch Udemy machine-learning videos
                      (3) Seek to apply Iono_learn
